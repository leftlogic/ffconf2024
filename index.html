                  We shouldn't be building "the web" - a monolith, a monoculture - but better webs. Indie webs. Small
                  webs. Solar-powered webs. Poetic webs. All undergirded by healthy roots/infrastructure and
                  interlinked, interconnected and interoperable.

                <dd>I completed the installation of the NTL dial-up on our family computer the first time we had access
                  to the internet. It was only putting a CD into the computer and following a wizard but I remember how
                  incredibly novel it felt! The internet timed out every 20 minutes and I mostly played games at that
                  point, but I have been extremely online ever since.

                <dd>Depending on what you read, and who you believe, AI is either the ultimate solution or armageddon in
                  motion, so in this talk, LÃ©onie is going to cut through the clickbait, dodge the doomscrollers, and
                  focus on the facts to bring you the good, the bad, and the bollocks of AI and accessibility.</dd>

                <dd>Copied code from Apple magazine onto my Dad's Apple IIE in about 1982. Syntax error on line 1.
                  Studied Performing Arts in the early 90s. Didn't get famous. Bought a modem. Joined Compuserv. Not
                  entirely sure what happened to the next 30 years, but apparently here I am.

                <dd>More often than not, front-end developers will focus purely on improving their technical skills. I'm
                  going to show you a better way by demonstrating how you can produce simpler, more resilient codebases
                  by improving your planning &amp; core skills â€” specifically improving how you provide and receive
                  feedback
                  from designer colleagues.</dd>

                <dd>We started running workshops in London and before we knew it (10 years later) we'd grown a global
                  community of 25,000 people. I'll talk through everything I've learnt!</dd>
                <dt>Origin Story</dt>
                <dd>I built my first website as part of my media course at college. I loved knowing I could build
                  anything, so changed path from originally wanting to study Law at university to Media Production. The
                  course was perfect for people who didn't know what they wanted to do but liked building things for the
                  internet. So I basically spent 3 years building websites, apps and 3D games. The rest as they say is
                  history!

                <dd>Critical thinking offers a framework for questioning and evaluating claims. By challenging
                  assumptions, using evidence-based reasoning, and recognising our bias, we're able to come to better
                  solutions. Mike will outline how a sceptical approach can help avoid common pitfalls and foster more
                  reliable decisions.</dd>

                  Art and design require imagination, yet in our busy lives, we often neglect reflection, which is
                  essential for self-growth and long-term success; Imran's talk will explore how taking time to reflect
                  can help us learn from our experiences and shape a better future.
